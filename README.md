How do I approach designing software?
The first thing I do when designing software is create functions and objects that can be used for the general project. I then go in order of priority or what needs to be worked on before being able to create the next part. For example, I must create the objects in a 3D scene before creating the textures. This makes it easier to implement things in real time.
